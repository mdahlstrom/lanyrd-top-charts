lanyrd top charts
====================

this is a small greasemonkey script for the lanyrd.com site, it collectes which of your conferences the people you follow on twitter are planning on attending and collects a top three chart of the busiest conferences goers you follow and which conference they are attending.

Using processing.js to render graphs, work in progress for the moment.

installation
---------------------

Install as a normal greasemonkey script: install greasmonkey if you are using firefox or ninjkit if you are using safari. drop the script into the browser and it should be installed. Next time you visit lanyrd you will see a new option in the main menu.
